## Inspiration
Cookie Clicker, a great game.
## What it does
Fetch what cookies you a website is using or other sites (uh oh) might be using. You are able to delete the cookies or search them up quickly with an external database provided by cookiesearch.org.
## How we built it
Initially built using a demo provided by Google for the chrome.cookies api, added some extra features.
## Challenges we ran into
Finding an API for the description/actual use of the cookie was next to impossible, and ideally this information would be displayed directly in the browser. Instead, we opted to use a website search instead.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
First time building something for a hackathon, so thats something.
## What we learned
It is hard to find an API for cookies not provided by chrome.
## What's next for cookie-checker
If you want to try it out, you can download from the repo linked below.

STEPS:
1. download "v4" folder from repo for most recent, otherwise select the other versions.
2. go to chrome://extensions
3. activate developer mode
4. click load unpacked
5. go to a website and try it out!

NOTES:
- Need to use a chromium-based browser, as it is a chrome extension. eg. Chrome, Opera, OperaGX, etc.
- Due to limited time and not enough resources, oftentimes, cookies are not documented and will not yield any search results. This is normal (unfortunately), but google has been planning to phase out third party cookies for quite some time now.
